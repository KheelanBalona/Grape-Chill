           Much like the bold journey of Marco Polo and company to the unknown worlds of East Asia, NASA is set to embark upon a 21 month manned mission to the surface of Mars by 2030. With this in mind, there are two rationales that people seem to align with when discussing a manned mission to another planet like Mars.

One side believes that by sending humans to Mars we are completing yet another great technological endeavor while gaining valuable understanding of life. The other rationale is that sending humans to Mars is a fancy feat that will merely appease our natural human curiosity. Simply put, on one hand we have the opportunity to explore a vast planet of unknown potential, and on the other hand we have a block of fancy cheese made to appease or curious senses.
1 Discover new forms of life

There have been many instances where we believed there were signs of life on Mars.

2 Valuable Natural Resources

Mars has several elements that are the raw materials that could be harvested and utilized to support and expand human exploration of Mars and beyond. We could essentially gather materials, construct space vehicles, and launch to other planetary bodies from the surface of Mars without wasting time and resources here on Earth. For example, Methane, which is found in high abundance on Mars, could be used to construct plastic based structures

Some day the global population may not be able to survive off the resources here on Earth. We also have a large global stockpile of nuclear weapons that could destroy the planet multiple times.

Then there is threat of asteroids hitting the planet and causing a worldwide catastrophe. This may seem like complete science fiction, but according to a press release by the Near Earth Tracking Project “An asteroid large enough to wipe out France hurtled past the Earth at a distance of a half-million miles just days after scientists spotted it. The asteroid, dubbed 2001 YB5, came within 520,000 miles of Earth on Monday, approximately twice the distance of the moon. “. That asteroid could have caused a global catastrophe and there was very little we could have done to change that.
